1. e4 e6 { The defining move of the French Defense. Moves like ...e5 and ...c5 immediately fight for space in the center by taking control of the d4. The French Defense, on the other hand, attempts to challenge white's central pawn structure with ...e6 followed by ...d5. } 2. d4 (2. d3 { The King's Indian Attack. This move is generally followed by Nd2, g3, Bg2, etc. White will aim for a kingside attack. Black can play ...d5 or transpose into a Sicilian with ...c5. } { [%cal Gc7c5,Gd7d5] })  (2. Nf3 d5 3. e5 c5 4. b4 { The Wing Gambit, White sacrifices a pawn in order to gain more control over the d4 square. } { [%csl Gd4][%cal Gc5d4] } 4... cxb4 5. d4)  (2. f4 { The La Bourdonnais Variation. White is usually planning on playing d4, but not until it is fully prepared. This way he has more time to get ready for the pressure on d4. }) 2... d5 { Black strikes out in the center, challenging white's e4 pawn. Here white has 4 main options. } 3. e5 { White immediately breaks the tension in the center while gaining space. Now that the center is locked, black can start attacking white's central pawn chain with ...c5, ...Nc6, often ...Qb6, and sometimes ...f6. } { [%csl Gd4,Ge5][%cal Gc7c5,Gb8c6,Gd8b6,Gf7f6] } (3. Nc3 { White's most aggressive option. White keeps the tension in the center by defending his e4 pawn. Black can indirectly attack the e4 pawn with ...Bb4, or directly attack it with ...Nf6. } { [%cal Gf8b4,Gg8f6] } 3... Bb4 { Here we have the Winawer variation: a sharp, tactical, and often aggressive variation. Black is prepared to give up his good dark-squared bishop in exchange for damaging white's pawn structure. It tremendously weakens the kingside, however, so white will often have a strong kingside attack. } { after 3...Bb4 , white can play a3 immediately leads in interesting position hope u like it } { [%csl Gg7,Ge4][%cal Gb4e1,Gc3e4] } (3... Nf6 { This is a simpler and more strategic alternative to the Winawer. Black pressures white's center directly. White has two options. } { [%cal Ge4e5,Gc1g5] } 4. e5 { White closes the center with a gain of tempo. Black will now attack white's central pawn chain with typical moves like ...c5, ...Nc6, ...Qb6, ...f6. } { [%cal Gf6d7,Gc7c5,Gb8c6,Gd8b6,Gf7f6] } (4. Bg5 { White takes pressure off of e4 by pinning the knight that was attacking it. This is one of white's most aggressive ways to play. It will often involve a kingside attack. Black has 3 main options. } { [%cal Gf8e7,Gf8b4,Gd5e4] } 4... Be7 { Black simply breaks the pin. White will close the center with e5, and black will be able to attack the center, but he must exchange his good bishop. } (4... Bb4 { The MacCutcheon Variation. Black puts even more pressure on e4 by pinning white's knight. This move leads to somewhat tactical positions, but they are far more positional than the Winawer. (Black responds to e5 with ...h6. White cannot win a piece). } { [%cal Ge4e5,Gh7h6] })  (4... dxe4 { The Burn Variation. The positions arising after this move are quite different from typical French positions. Black accepts doubled f-pawns for dynamic compensation. } 5. Nxe4 Be7 6. Bxf6 gxf6 { Black can make use of the semi-open g-file. The cluster of pawns on e6, f6, and f7 can often become very powerful as they can potentially control a lot of squares in the center. } { [%csl Gf6,Gf7,Ge6][%cal Gh8g8,Gg8g1,Gc7c5] })))  (3... dxe4 { This is the Rubinstein (or the Fort Knox if black plays ...Bc8-d7-c6). Black accepts a potentially passive position with less space, but obtains a solid position. } { [%cal Gc7c6,Gb8d7,Gg8f6,Gf8e7,Gf8d6] } 4. Nxe4 Bd7 { This is the Fort Knox Variation, where black spends time to bring his light-squared bishop out and, at the right moment, trades it for (usually) a white knight on f3. } { [%cal Gd7c6,Gc6f3] }) 4. a3 Bxc3+ 5. bxc3 dxe4 6.

{ The Tarrasch Variation of the French doesn't come close to matching the sharp, tactical positions of the Winawer. It instead provides a more strategic and positional game. So while the Winawer includes plenty of attacking sacrifices, the Tarrasch has many positional sacrifices. }

1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 { Normally in this position, White supports his central pawn chain with c3, but there is another interesting idea for White. One of Nimzowitsch's key concepts in "My System" is overprotection. In the two following lines, White sacrifices the d4 pawn in order to over protect e5, which can become sort of a wedge in White's position. } 3... c5 4. Nf3 { Rather than support the pawn chain as usual with c3, White simply develops a piece while defending d4. } 4... cxd4 { Since White didn't support the central pawn chain, Black can simply remove the base of it. Now White's e5 pawn is weaker. } { [%csl Ge5] } 5. Bd3 { If White simply takes back with the knight, Black will be a little better, so he instead blocks the pawn while developing a piece and preparing to castle. } 5... Nc6 { Black can develop, defend the d4 pawn, and put pressure on White's e5 pawn. } { [%cal Gc6d4,Gc6e5] } 6. O-O { Now the rook may be able to go to e1, where it supports e5. } { [%csl Ge5][%cal Gf1e1,Ge1e5] } 6... Nge7 { The knight is heading to g6, where it attacks White's e5 pawn. } 7. Bf4 { Since a knight on g6 will control the f4 square, now is White's only chance to play Bf4, where the bishop can support the e5 pawn. } { [%cal Gf4e5] } 7... Ng6 { [%cal Gg6e5,Gg6f4] } 8. Bg3 { Both sides are fighting for control of the e5 pawn. The winner of the battle will have a clear advantage. } { [%cal Gg6e5,Gc6e5,Gf3e5,Gg3e5] } 8... Bc5 { This bishop defends the d4 pawn, but the main purpose of this move is to reroute the bishop to c7, where it attacks e5. } { [%cal Gc5b6,Gb6c7,Gc7e5] } 9. Nbd2 { The knight is heading to g3, where it attacks d4. Once White has control of e5, he would like to land a piece on d4. } { [%cal Gd2b3,Gb3d4] } 9... Bd7 { This is a developing move, but it also allows the queen to go to b8, where it can attack e5 (c7 is occupied by the bishop). } { [%cal Gc5b6,Gb6c7,Gd8b8,Gb8e5] } 10. Nb3 { Another common idea is to play a3, b4, and at some point b5, to kick black's knight on c6 away and gain more control of e5. } { [%cal Gb3d4] } 10... Bb6 { The bishop was attacked and is heading to c7 anyway. } { [%cal Gb6c7] } 11. h4 { White is ready to play h5, attacking white's knight and decreasing black's control of e5. } { [%cal Gh4h5,Gg6e5,Gh5g6] } 11... Bc7 { [%cal Gc7e5] } 12. Re1 { [%cal Ge1e5] } 12... Qb8 { [%cal Gb8e5] } 13. Qe2 { In this position, both sides have almost all of their pieces aimed at e5, but it looks like White is winning. Because White has overprotected e5, it will become an irremovable wedge in Black's position. ...f6 will not be good for Black because White has too much control of e5 (and d4), and Black will remain cramped. } { [%csl Ge5][%cal Ge1e5,Ge2e5,Gf3e5,Gg3e5,Gg6e5,Gc6e5,Gc7e5,Gb8e5,Gh4h5] } 13... a5 { This move was a mistake. Attacking the knight on b3 is useless since White is going to take on d4 anyway. This move gains space on the queenside, but is not the most effective way to do so. } 14. Nbxd4 { White regains his pawn and sets up an effective blockade on d4. } 14... Nxd4 15. Nxd4 Ne7 { This knight is best placed on c6 and was going to be kicked back to e7 by h5 from White. } { [%cal Ge7c6] } 16. h5 { White plays h5 anyway. This move is still useful as it gains space on the kingside. } 16... Qa7 { Black lost the battle for e5, so now he attempts to get White off of d4. } { [%cal Ga7d4] } 17. Qg4 { This move defends d4 and puts pressure on g7 (Qxg7 is not a good move yet, but putting pressure on g7 is still useful). } { [%cal Gg4g7,Gg4d4] } 17... Bb6 { Black attacks d4 again, but it is useless. } { [%cal Gb6d4] } 18. c3 Bxd4 19. cxd4 { At this point White is clearly better. White has the bishop pair, a strong central pawn chain, more space, and more active pieces. White overprotected e5 and maintained control over d4, which prevented Black from achieving any sort of counterplay whatsoever. } 19... Nc6 20. Qxg7 O-O-O 21. Bxh7 Qxd4 22. h6 Rdf8 23.

{ In this chapter I will share a very interesting novelty by Sergey Volkov in the French Defense. He has played this move only twice, and won both games. I will not spend too much time explaining the moves leading up to the novelty; I will focus mainly on the move itself and the moves following. }
1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 Bb4 { This is the defining move of the MacCutcheon variation. By pinning the knight, Black is indirectly attacking e4. In doing so, he is provoking White to play e5, thus closing the center and reaching the typical French Defense pawn structure. } 5. e5 h6 { at 6th instead of Bd2 white can also play exf6 and can reach in interesting line....... } 6.

Rg8 { This move has only been played twice (both by Sergey Volkov), and has a simple idea: to defend the g7 pawn and allow the king to escape to the queenside. } 14. Ne2 { White continues as normal and prepares the kingside attack. He does not realize, however, that the black king will be long gone by the time the attack is ready. } { [%cal Ge2f4,Gf4h5] } 14... Ke7 { Black begins the king-march to the queenside. } 15. Nf4 { [%cal Gf4h5] } 15... Qf8 { Black defends the f7 pawn and vacates the d8 square for the king. } { [%cal Gf8f7] } 16. Rf3 { With the king on the queenside, Black can try to obtain counterplay on the kingside. } { [%cal Gf3f8] } (16. Be2 { Now that the knight is on f4, the bishop can go to e2. This allows the rook on a1 to be involved in the attack. But this idea is still too slow. } { [%cal Ga1h1] } 16... Kd8 17. Nh5 { [%cal Gf2f4,Gf4f5] } 17... Bd7 18. Qf4 { Rather than play for f4 and f5, white is going to thrust his g-pawn forward. } { [%cal Gg2g4,Gg4g5] } 18... Kc7 19. g4 Qa3 { Black's king is safe for now, but a successful kingside attack by White will still be extremely dangerous, so he starts his counterplay on the queenside. } 20.

He is now preparing f4 and f5. } { [%cal Gf2f4,Gf4f5] } 20... b5 { A common move for Black in these types of positions. ...b4 is coming. } { [%cal Gb5b4] } 21. f4 Rab8 { With the b-file about to be opened, Black gets his rook on an ideal square. } 22. Rhh1 { White intends to go Rf1 and support the f5 push. Also, this allows him to meet ...Qb2 with Rhb1. } 22... a5 23. Rhf1 { [%cal Gf1f5,Gf4f5] } 23... b4 { Finally Black is able to effectively play ...b4. } 24. f5 { With Black's queenside play progressing quickly, White needs to get his play on the kingside going. } 24... Qb2 25. Rfb1 { White's rook is now forced to leave the f-file. } 25... Qa3 { Here we have a position in which both sides have a lot of play. Black's king is not nearly as vulnerable as it was on f8, which gives him extra time to gain queenside counterplay. }) 16... Kd8 17. a4 { With this move, White temporarily prevents ...b5, giving himself more time for his kingside play. The problem with this is that, with Black's king on the queenside, Black can get his own counterplay on the kingside with ...f6. } { [%cal Gf7f6] } 17... Bd7 18. g3 { [%cal Gf1h3] } 18... Kc7 19. Bh3 Qe7 { [%cal Ga8f8] } 20. Ng2 { This move is not very good either. White is planning to bring the knight to e3, but on that square it does nothing except prepare f5, which is way too slow. } { [%cal Gg2e3] } 20... Raf8 { This move supports ...f6 and allows the king to go to the back rank without disconnecting the rooks. } { [%cal Gf7f6,Gc7c8] } 21. Ne3 Kc8 22. Qf4 f6 { With the king on the queenside, Black is free to counterattack on the kingside. With the typical French Defense pawn break, Black chips away at White's center and opens the f-file. } { [%cal Gf8f1,Gf6e5] } 23. exf6 Rxf6 24. Qg4 Rxf3 25. Qxf3 Rf8 { White has lost any chances of a kingside attack. Black now more active and slightly better. } { [%cal Gf8f2,Ge6e5,Gd7h3] } *

{ With this move, White doesn't want the symmetrical pawn structure typically associated with the French Exchange, and instead opts for an IQP position. The most common reply to c4 is ...Nf6, after which we reach a typical IQP position. This is perfectly fine for Black, but there is one uncommon move that I prefer in this position. }
1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. exd5 exd5 4. c4 Nc6 { This move at first doesn't make much sense, as it does nothing to help control the d5 square. It seems as though white can simply take on d5 and gain tempi on the queen. But, Black's knight is attacking d4, which creates some interesting options after cxd5. This position is a hybrid of the Chigorin Defense (1. d5 d5 2. c4 Nc6) and the French Exchange, and is a great surprise weapon with interesting possibilities. } *
